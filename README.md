## Content
- **Calculatrice Papillon**: An attempt at a nicer looking calculator. My first time experimenting with an intpreter (to compute the results of the computations)

- **Snake**: The game snake, adapted to be played with a touc screen.
- **Timer**: A nice looking timer, with a special feature to also work as a stopwatch when stopped. Useful for certain sport activities.
- **Map**: A slippy map implementation from the fround up. Support panning and zooming gesture. Displays OpenStreetMap data.
- **Maze Solver**: Creates then solves mazes using A* path finding
- **Astro Boom**: An old game I made, inspired by Breakout.
- **LLay**: The Lua Layout library! A simple UI layout library inspired by [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)
- **Projet Browser**: A simple UI to see and browse your other Codea projects.
- **Asset Picker**: A simple UI to import assets to an app or a game.
- **Speedometer**: A nice-looking speedometer based on GPS velocity.
